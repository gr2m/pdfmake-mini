# pdfmake-mini

> the essence of pdfmake

# note: this is work in progress

## Scope

`pdfmake-mini` is a fork of [pdfmake](http://pdfmake.org/), with the goal
to slim it down as much as possible. Basically, I'd like to create a
[pdfkit](https://github.com/pdfkit/pdfkit) plugin that is compatible
with pdfmake's content declaration.

## Demo / Playground

```
git clone git@github.com:gr2m/pdf-editor.git
git checkout pdfmake-mini
cd pdf-editor
npm install
npm start
```
